‚úè Minimax Algorithm in Tic Tac Toe

The minimax algorithm is an artificial intelligence technique used to make strategic decisions in two-player turn-based games like Tic Tac Toe. Its goal is to find the best possible move for a player, assuming that the opponent will also play optimally and always try to minimize the player's gain [(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/finding-optimal-move-in-tic-tac-toe-using-minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory/)].

üìö ‚úèÔ∏è How does the minimax algorithm work?

1. Simulating all possible moves:  
   The algorithm explores all legal moves from the current position, building a decision tree where each node is a possible board state and each branch is a move [(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/adversarial-search-algorithms/)].
2. Evaluating terminal states:  
   When a terminal state (win, loss, or draw) is reached, a value or "utility" is assigned to that state, for example:
    ‚¶Å +10 if the current player wins
    ‚¶Å -10 if the player loses
    ‚¶Å 0 if it is a draw
3. Backtracking and value assignment:  
   Nodes are evaluated from the leaves up to the root.
    ‚¶Å On the player's (Max's) turn, the move that maximizes the value is chosen.
    ‚¶Å On the opponent‚Äôs (Min‚Äôs) turn, the move that minimizes the value is chosen, assuming the opponent blocks our objectives [(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/adversarial-search-algorithms/),(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)].
4. Selecting the best move:  
   In the end, the algorithm recommends the move that leads to the optimal result, even facing the worst-case scenario (perfect defense by the rival) [(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/adversarial-search-algorithms/)].

üìö üìö Simple Example in Tic Tac Toe

‚¶Å If there is an immediate winning move, it is chosen instantly.
‚¶Å If not, the algorithm recursively calculates the best move by considering all possible future moves and responses from the opponent.

üìö ‚úèÔ∏è Code Implementation

‚¶Å play: Main function that selects and executes the best possible move for the current turn (default is 'x', but configurable). If there is an immediate winning move, it takes it; otherwise, it uses minimax to explore all possible moves and chooses the one that maximizes the result for the current player. If there are several optimal moves, it picks one at random.
‚¶Å minimax: Recursive algorithm that simulates all possible moves, alternating between the AI's turn (maximizes utility) and the opponent's turn (minimizes utility). Assigns +10 if the current player wins, -10 if they lose, and 0 for a draw. Uses the aiTurn parameter to alternate between maximizing and minimizing.
‚¶Å terminal: Evaluates if the board is in a final state (win, loss, or draw) and returns the corresponding value.
‚¶Å nextTurn: Returns the symbol of the next player ('x' or 'o').
‚¶Å actions: Returns an array with the indices of the available empty squares to play.
‚¶Å result: Returns a new board with the move applied at the indicated position.
‚¶Å getRandomIndex: Helps to randomly choose among the best possible moves when there is a tie in score. The goal is to add variability to the behavior so that games do not feel monotonous.

üìö ‚úèÔ∏è Conceptual Summary

Minimax guarantees that the player always makes the best move in every turn, minimizing potential losses against a perfect opponent. It‚Äôs ideal for zero-sum games and is widely used in chess, checkers, tic tac toe, and more [(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/artificial-intelligence/adversarial-search-algorithms/),(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)].
